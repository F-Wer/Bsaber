# Download your bookmarked songs from bsaber.com

Currently the connection between BeatSync and bsaber.com wasn't working and I wanted to have my bookmarked songs on Beat Saber.

Therefore I wrote a program that gets the bookmarks from a person and downloads the songs. After this you have to add them to Beat Saber. 
[Here you can find a link how to add them to Beat Saber](https://bsaber.com/oculus-quest-custom-songs/)


To use this program you have to have python and pip installed and then run the following commands:
```python
pip install requirements.txt
python main.py --username USERNAME --path PATH
```

You have to add your username and the path where the songs will be saved to run this script.

If you have an idea to improve this script or if something isn't working please open a issue and you are free to open a pull request.
